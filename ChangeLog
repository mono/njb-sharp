	* configure.ac: Version 0.2.1

	* src/Makefile.am: Install to $(pkglibdir)
	
	* src/en/*: Updated documentation

2005-12-18  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>

	* src/en/*: Updated documentation

	* src/DeviceId.cs: Make table more easily readable

	* src/Device.cs: Changed Songs and DataFiles properties to GetSongs and
	GetDataFiles methods returning an ICollection as the tasks are expensive
	and exposing as properties is misleading (framework design guidelines);
	uppercase the SDMIID

	* src/Song.cs: Changed Frames property to GetFrames method as the 
	operation is expensive (conform to .NET framework design guidelines);
	changed Length (ushort) property to Duration (TimeSpan); added a Device
	property for 'parent' lookups

	* src/NjbTest.cs: Updated to reflect change from properties to methods
	for GetSongs()

2005-12-18  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>
	
	* njb-sharp.mdp: Updated MonoDevelop project

	* src/njb-sharp.dll.config.in: DLL Map; should remain unused directly
	in consuming applications for now, but can serve as a template for the
	end application to use

	* configure.ac: Added expanded_libdir variable and generate a DLL map
	
	* src/Device.cs (Dispose): Only call NJB_Close if Handle is still valid
	
	* src/Discoverer.cs: Added a Rescan method which may need to be used
	for rediscovering potentially new devices. Refreshes the device list
	cache. Very useful if consuming application also uses HAL for device
	notification.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added DeviceId.cs

	* src/DeviceId.cs: Simple class and static table to perform "pre" device
	lookup to verify if a USB device will most likely be supported by libnjb.
	Lookups to table are performed based on USB vendor and product IDs. This
	is useful for HAL-based detection, where probing Njb.Discoverer may be
	costly for each [USB] device in the system. Also maps device names to
	something more suitable for display.

2005-12-17  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>

	* src/Device.cs: Added support for finding the USB bus and file path
	of the device; Added overrides for Equals and GetHashCode methods
	based on UsbDeviceId and UsbBusPath properties

	* src/njb-glue.c: Added two new helper methods to proxy device path and	
	filename information from underlying libusb structures

	* src/en/*: Updated docs

2005-12-01  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>

	* configure.ac: Fixed typo in detecting MONODOCER, bumped to version 0.2
	* src/Makefile.am: Added DataFile.cs, link against Mono.Posix.dll
	* njb-sharp.md[sp]: MonoDevelop solution/project file
	* src/Device.cs: Added fetch support for songs; fixed minor syntax issues;
	added DataFile container list support; do not cache Song/DataFile objects
	* src/Global.cs:
	* src/SongFrame.cs: 
	* src/Song.cs: fixed syntaxt issues
	* src/Discoverer.cs: Remove IDisposable, fixed minor syntax issues
